In PHP, when users submit HTML5 forms, the form data is sent to PHP scripts for processing. PHP provides $_POST and $_GET superglobal arrays to access this data based on the form's submission method ("post" or "get"). $_POST is used for data sent via the "post" method, while $_GET is for data sent via the "get" method. These superglobal arrays allow PHP scripts to retrieve and manipulate form data, enabling dynamic and interactive web applications.
