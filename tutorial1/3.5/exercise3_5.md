NOTE: I had to remove the "<>" or add spaces in the statements so the actual statements show for this exercise.

a) Using a meter element to indicate the average rating:

< p > Rating: < meter value="7" min="1" max="10">7 out of 10< /meter> < /p >

b) Creating a details element with summary and explanatory paragraph:

< details>

    < summary>Survey Results</ summary>

    < p>Students were asked to rate the food in the cafeteria on a scale of 1 to 10. The average rating was 7 out of 10.</ p>

< /details>

c) Creating a text input element for a first name with autofocus:

< input type="text" name="firstName" autofocus>

d) Modifying Part (c) to use placeholder text instead of a label:

< input type="text" name="firstName" placeholder="Enter your first name" autofocus>
