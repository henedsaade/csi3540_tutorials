a) window.alert( "x = " + x );
This will display an alert dialog with the message "x = 2". It concatenates the string "x = " with the value of variable x (which is 2).

b) window.alert( "The value of x + x is " + ( x + x ) );
This will display an alert dialog with the message "The value of x + x is 4". It first evaluates the expression inside the parentheses (x + x), which equals 4, and then concatenates the result with the preceding string.

c) window.alert( "x =" );
This will display an alert dialog with the message "x =". It simply displays the string "x =".

d) window.alert( ( x + y ) + "=" + ( y + x ) );
This will display an alert dialog with the message "5=5". It first evaluates the expressions inside the parentheses, which are (2 + 3) and (3 + 2), resulting in 5 for both. Then it concatenates the results with the "=" symbol in between.
