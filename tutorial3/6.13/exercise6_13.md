a) y = a * x * x * x + 7;
This statement correctly represents the equation. It multiplies a by x^3 and then adds 7.

b) y = a * x * x * (x + 7);
This statement does not represent the equation correctly. It multiplies a by x^2 and then multiplies the result by (x+7), which is not equivalent to ax^3 + 7.

c) y = (a * x) * x * (x + 7);
This statement does not represent the equation correctly. It multipliesa by x and then multiplies the result by (x+7), which is not equivalent to ax^3 + 7.

d) y = (a * x) * x * x + 7;
This statement correctly represents the equation. It multiplies a by x, then multiplies the result by x^2, and finally adds 7.

e) y = a * (x * x * x) + 7;
This statement correctly represents the equation. It multiplies x^3 by a and then adds 7.

f) y = a * x * (x * x + 7);
This statement does not represent the equation correctly. It multiplies x^2 by a and then multiplies the result by (x^2 +7), which is not equivalent to ax^3 + 7.

Correct statements: a), d), and e).
