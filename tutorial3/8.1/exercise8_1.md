a) False. The default case in a switch selection statement is optional. It is used when none of the case values match the switch expression.

b) False. The break statement is not required in the last case of a switch selection statement if you want execution to fall through to the next case. However, in most cases, you would include a break statement to prevent this fall-through behavior.

c) False. The expression ( x > y && a < b ) is true only if both x > y and a < b are true. It uses the logical AND (&&) operator, which requires both conditions to be true for the entire expression to be true.

d) True. An expression containing the || (logical OR) operator is true if either or both of its operands are true. It evaluates to true as long as at least one of the operands is true.
