a) False. Comments in JavaScript, indicated by // or /* */, are ignored by the interpreter and do not affect the execution of the script. They are used for documentation or for temporarily disabling code.

b) False. JavaScript is case-sensitive, so it considers number and NuMbEr as two different variables.

c) False. The remainder operator (%) can be used with both numeric and string operands. However, when used with strings, it performs string concatenation instead of arithmetic operation.

d) False. The arithmetic operators have different levels of precedence. Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-). The remainder (%) operator also has a precedence level similar to multiplication and division.

e) False. The parseInt method in JavaScript converts a string to an integer, not the other way around.
