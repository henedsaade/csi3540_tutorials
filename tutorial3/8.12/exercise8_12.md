a) document.writeln( i == 1 );

Since i is equal to 1, this statement will print true. The parentheses are not necessary in this case, but they don't cause any issue.

b) document.writeln( j == 3 );

Since j is equal to 2, this statement will print false. The parentheses are not necessary in this case, but they don't cause any issue.

c) document.writeln( i >= 1 && j < 4 );

i >= 1 evaluates to true, and j < 4 also evaluates to true. The logical AND operator (&&) requires both expressions to be true for the entire expression to be true. So, this statement will print true. The parentheses are not necessary in this case, but they don't cause any issue.

d) document.writeln( m <= 99 && k < m );

m <= 99 evaluates to true, and k < m also evaluates to true. So, this statement will print true. The parentheses are not necessary in this case, but they don't cause any issue.

e) document.writeln( j >= i || k == m );

j >= i evaluates to true, and k == m evaluates to true. The logical OR operator (||) requires only one expression to be true for the entire expression to be true. So, this statement will print true. The parentheses are not necessary in this case, but they don't cause any issue.

f) document.writeln( k + m < j || 3 - j >= k );

k + m < j evaluates to true, and 3 - j >= k also evaluates to true. So, this statement will print true. The parentheses are not necessary in this case, but they don't cause any issue.

g) document.writeln( !( k > m ) );

k > m evaluates to false. The logical NOT operator (!) negates the result, so !(false) evaluates to true. So, this statement will print true. The parentheses are not necessary in this case, but they don't cause any issue. 

In summary, the parentheses are not necessary in any of these cases, but they do not cause any issues either.
