a) False. JavaScript operators have different levels of precedence, and they are evaluated based on operator precedence rules, not strictly from left to right. For example, multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.

b) True. All the listed variable names are valid in JavaScript. Variable names can include letters, numbers, underscores (_), and dollar signs ($), but they cannot start with a number.

c) True. In a valid JavaScript arithmetic expression with no parentheses, the expression is evaluated from left to right based on operator precedence rules.

d) False. Variable names cannot start with a number in JavaScript. Therefore, variable names like 3g, 87, 67h2, h22, and 2h are invalid.
