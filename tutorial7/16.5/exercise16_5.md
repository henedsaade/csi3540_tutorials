a) Type-ahead: Refers to a feature where the application predicts and suggests possible completions or matches for user input as they type, typically used in search boxes or forms.

b) Edit-in-place: Allows users to directly edit content within a web page without navigating to a separate editing interface. This is often achieved by converting static text or elements into input fields when clicked or double-clicked.

c) Partial page update: Involves refreshing only specific portions of a web page, rather than reloading the entire page, to reflect changes or new data retrieved from the server. This approach enhances performance and user experience by reducing unnecessary data transfer.

d) Asynchronous request: Denotes a type of HTTP request where the client application sends a request to the server and continues to execute other tasks without waiting for a response. This enables non-blocking behavior, allowing the application to remain responsive while waiting for data.

e) XMLHttpRequest: A built-in browser object that allows JavaScript to make asynchronous HTTP requests to the server, enabling data exchange between the client and server without reloading the entire page.

f) "Raw" Ajax: Refers to the use of XMLHttpRequest directly in JavaScript code, without the use of higher-level libraries or frameworks. This approach offers fine-grained control over the Ajax functionality but may require more coding effort.

g) Callback function: A function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked or "called back" at a later time, typically after the completion of an asynchronous operation such as an Ajax request. Callback functions are commonly used to handle responses from server requests.

h) Same origin policy: A security feature enforced by web browsers that restricts JavaScript code from making Ajax requests to domains other than the one from which the script originated. This policy prevents malicious scripts from accessing sensitive data from other domains.

i) Ajax libraries: Pre-built JavaScript libraries or frameworks that provide ready-to-use functions and utilities for implementing Ajax functionality in web applications. These libraries simplify Ajax development by abstracting away low-level details and offering features like cross-browser compatibility and error handling.

j) RIA (Rich Internet Application): Refers to web applications that offer enhanced functionality and user experience similar to traditional desktop applications. Ajax plays a significant role in building RIAs by enabling dynamic and interactive features such as drag-and-drop, real-time updates, and multimedia content.
