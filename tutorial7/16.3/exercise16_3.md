Traditional web applications typically follow a request-response model, where each user action triggers a full-page reload or navigation to a new URL, resulting in noticeable delays. In contrast, Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) web applications use asynchronous communication techniques to enhance user experience and interactivity. By sending requests to the server in the background and updating only specific parts of the page, Ajax applications provide smoother and more responsive user interfaces. This approach allows for dynamic content updates without requiring full page reloads, leading to a more seamless and interactive user experience. Additionally, Ajax enables features such as autocomplete search fields and live data updates, enhancing the overall usability of web applications.
