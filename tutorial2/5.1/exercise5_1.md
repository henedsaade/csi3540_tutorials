Here are the completed statements:

a) The text-shadow property makes it easy to add a text shadow effect to any text.

b) The border-radius property allows you to add rounded corners to any element.

c) CSS3 includes two new ways to express color—rgba() and hsla().

d) The box-shadow property defines the number of pixels that the box-shadow will appear to the left or the right of the box.

e) Radial gradients are similar to linear gradients, but the color changes gradually from an inner circle (the start) to an outer circle (the end).

f) The border-image property divides the image into nine regions: four corners, four sides, and a middle, which is transparent unless otherwise specified.

g) The animation-timing-function determines how the animation progresses in one cycle of its duration. Possible values include ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, and linear.

h) For the element being animated, the keyframes rule defines the element’s properties that will change during the animation, the values to which those properties will change, and when they’ll change.

i) Transitions are similar in concept to animations, but they allow you to specify only the starting and ending values of the CSS properties being changed. An animation’s keyframes enable you to control intermediate states throughout the animation’s duration.

j) CSS3 allows you to move, rotate, scale, and skew elements.

k) CSS rules consist of one or more selectors followed by a declaration block in curly braces {}.

l) In CSS3, you can use attribute selectors to easily style attributes.
