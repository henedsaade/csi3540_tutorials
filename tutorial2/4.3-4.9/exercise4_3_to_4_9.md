Question 4.3:

To make all text 1.5 times larger than the base font size and color the text red, you can use the following CSS rule:

body {

    font-size: 1.5em;

    color: red;

}

This rule sets the font size to 1.5 times the default size and applies the color red to all text within the body element.

Question 4.4:

body {

    background-image: url('your_image.jpg'); /* Replace 'your_image.jpg' with the path to your background image */

    background-repeat: repeat-x; /* Tile the image horizontally */

    background-attachment: fixed; /* Keep the image in place while scrolling */

    background-position: center 50%; /* Center the image horizontally and position it halfway down the page */

}
