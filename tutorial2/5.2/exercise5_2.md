Here are the evaluations:

a) False. The @font-face rule specifies a custom font to be used in the rendering of text on a webpage, not specifically on a computer screen. It allows designers to specify online fonts to display text on their web pages, regardless of whether the fonts are installed on the user's device.

b) True. Gradients can be used in any property that accepts an image, such as the background-image property.

c) False. A horizontal gradient gradually changes from left to right, not from top to bottom. A vertical gradient changes from top to bottom.

d) False. The column-gap property sets the gap between the columns in a multi-column layout. To add lines between columns, you would use the column-rule property.

e) False. The @media rule is used to apply styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as its width, height, orientation, or resolution. If the conditions specified in the @media rule are met, its styles are applied, not the other way around.

f) False. To add multiple background images to an element, you would use the background-image property for each image, not the background-position. The background-position property specifies the position of a single background image, not multiple background images.
