The mystery function calculates the result of multiplying a by b using recursion. If b is equal to 1, it returns a. Otherwise, it returns the sum of a and the result of the mystery function called with the arguments a and b - 1. In simpler terms, it performs repeated addition of a b times, which effectively gives the result of a * b. However, it's important to note that this function is only valid for positive integer values of b to prevent infinite recursion.
